        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Aditi Mahangade, and I am a student at The University of Oklahoma, pursuing a degree in Management Information Systems with a minor in Computer Science. I have always had a passion for technology and how it can be used to drive change in the world. My journey into IT began at a young age, and since then, I have been constantly looking for ways to enhance my skills in both software development and IT management. I am always eager to learn new things and take on challenges that help me grow both personally and professionally.</p>
